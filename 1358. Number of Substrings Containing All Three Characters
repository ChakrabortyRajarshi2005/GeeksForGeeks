Hint
Given a string s consisting only of characters a, b and c.

Return the number of substrings containing at least one occurrence of all these characters a, b and c.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcabc"
Output: 10
Explanation: The substrings containing at least one occurrence of the characters a, b and c are "abc", "abca", "abcab", "abcabc", "bca", "bcab", "bcabc", "cab", "cabc" and "abc" (again). 
Example 2:

Input: s = "aaacb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The substrings containing at least one occurrence of the characters a, b and c are "aaacb", "aacb" and "acb". 
Example 3:

Input: s = "abc"
Output: 1
 

Constraints:

3 <= s.length <= 5 x 10^4
s only consists of a, b or c characters.
class Solution {
    public int numberOfSubstrings(String s) {
        int len = s.length();
        // Track last position of a, b, c
        int[] lastPos = { -1, -1, -1 };
        int total = 0;

        for (int pos = 0; pos < len; pos++) {
            // Update last position of current character
            lastPos[s.charAt(pos) - 'a'] = pos;

            // Add count of valid substrings ending at current position
            // If any character is missing, min will be -1
            // Else min gives leftmost required character position
            total += 1 + Math.min(lastPos[0], Math.min(lastPos[1], lastPos[2]));
        }

        return total;
    }
}
