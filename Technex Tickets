Technex Tickets
You are standing in a queue that is infinitely long, waiting to get tickets for various events during Technex.
The ticket distribution follows these rules:

Every second, tickets are given to the

t
1 
st
  and 
3
r
d
3

1 
st
  and 
3
r
d
3 
rd
  people left) moves up to the 
1
s
t
1 
st
  position.
This process repeats every second, with the 
1
s
t
1 
st
  and 
3
r
d
3 
rd
  persons receiving tickets and leaving.
Initially, you are at position 
N
N in the queue.

Determine after how many seconds you will get the tickets.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer 
T
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case contains a single line of input 
N
N your initial position in the line.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line after how many seconds will you get the tickets.
