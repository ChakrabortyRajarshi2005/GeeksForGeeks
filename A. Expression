Petya studies in a school and he adores Maths. His class has been studying arithmetic expressions. On the last class the teacher wrote three positive integers a, b, c on the blackboard. The task was to insert signs of operations '+' and '*', and probably brackets between the numbers so that the value of the resulting expression is as large as possible. Let's consider an example: assume that the teacher wrote numbers 1, 2 and 3 on the blackboard. Here are some ways of placing signs and brackets:

1+2*3=7
1*(2+3)=5
1*2*3=6
(1+2)*3=9
Note that you can insert operation signs only between a and b, and between b and c, that is, you cannot swap integers. For instance, in the given sample you cannot get expression (1+3)*2.

It's easy to see that the maximum value that you can obtain is 9.

Your task is: given a, b and c print the maximum value that you can get.

Input
The input contains three integers a, b and c, each on a single line (1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10).

Output
Print the maximum value of the expression that you can obtain.

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Expression {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Input the three integers a, b, c
        int a = scanner.nextInt();
        int b = scanner.nextInt();
        int c = scanner.nextInt();

        // Calculate all possible results of expressions
        int result1 = a + b + c;
        int result2 = a * b * c;
        int result3 = a + (b * c);
        int result4 = (a + b) * c;
        int result5 = a * (b + c);
        
        // Find the maximum of all results
        int maxResult = Math.max(Math.max(Math.max(result1, result2), Math.max(result3, result4)), result5);

        // Output the maximum value
        System.out.println(maxResult);

        scanner.close();
    }
}
