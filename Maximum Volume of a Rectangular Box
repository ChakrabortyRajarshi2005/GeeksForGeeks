Maximum Volume of a Rectangular Box
Difficulty: EasyAccuracy: 29.02%Submissions: 6K+Points: 2
John was given a task to make a rectangular box during his innovation competition. He was given with
the A cm of wire and B cm2 of special paper. He had to use all the wire (for the 12 edges) and paper (for the 6 sides) to make the box. So what will be the maximum volume of that box?

 

Example 1:

Input:
A = 20, B = 14
Output:
3
Explanation:
The maximum volumed Rectangular
Box we can get is 3cm3.
Example 2:

Input:
A = 20, B = 16
Output:
4
Explanation:
The maximum volumed Rectangular
Box we can get is 4cm3.
 

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function getVol() which takes 2 Integers A, and B as input and returns the answer.

 

Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

 

Constraints:
1 <= A,B <= 106



class Solution {
    static long getVol(int A, int B) {
        double p = (double)A;
        double s = (double)B;
        double v = (36*p*s - Math.pow(p, 3) + Math.sqrt(Math.pow((p*p - 24*s), 3))) / (12*72);

		long ans  =  (long)(v);

		if (ans<0)
            ans=0;

		return ans;
    }
};
