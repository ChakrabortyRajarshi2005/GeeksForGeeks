Difficulty: EasyAccuracy: 31.32%Submissions: 154K+Points: 2
Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring with all distinct characters. 

Examples:

Input: s = "geeksforgeeks"
Output: 7
Explanation: "eksforg" is the longest substring with all distinct characters.
Input: s = "aaa"
Output: 1
Explanation: "a" is the longest substring with all distinct characters.
Input: s = "abcdefabcbb"
Output: 6
Explanation: The longest substring with all distinct characters is "abcdef", which has a length of 6.
Constraints:
1<= s.size()<=3*104
All the characters are in lowercase.


class Solution {
    static final int MAX_CHAR = 26;

    public int longestUniqueSubstr(String s) {
        if (s.length() == 0 || s.length() == 1) return s.length();

        int res = 0;
        boolean[] vis = new boolean[MAX_CHAR];

        int left = 0, right = 0;
        while (right < s.length()) {
            while (vis[s.charAt(right) - 'a'] == true) {
                vis[s.charAt(left) - 'a'] = false;
                left++;
            }

            vis[s.charAt(right) - 'a'] = true;
            res = Math.max(res, (right - left + 1));
            right++;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
